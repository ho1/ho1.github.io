## A New Post

Inspired by a project/book [Empty LA](http://mlogue.com/p586914549) by [Matt Logue](http://mlogue.com/), I decided to try to recreate the same type of photos of Stockholm. 

Using Photoshop's image stacking functionality and a few dozen exposures, I was able create photos of an empty Stockholm.

A few years later, I figured out how to skip Photoshop altogether in this process and use Python to automatically create these type of photos.
